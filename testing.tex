\begin{question}
What is the capital of Colorado?
\begin{solution}
Denver /answer{$6$}
\end{solution}

\begin{question} 
Suppose you are standing on a bridge that is 60 meters above
sea-level. You toss a ball up into the air with an initial velocity of
30 meters per second.  If $t$ is the time (in seconds) after we toss
the ball, then the height at time $t$ is approximately $f(t) = -5 t^2
+30t+60$. What does $f(2)$ mean in our context?
\begin{solution}
\begin{hint}
We want an answer in the context of the problem. 
\end{hint}
\begin{freeResponse}
The value $f(2)$ is the height of the ball after $2$ seconds.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{solution}
Now suppose $t$ is such that $f(t) = 100$. What does this mean in our
context?
\begin{solution}
\begin{hint}
We want an answer in the context of the problem. 
\end{hint}
\begin{freeResponse}
These value of $t$ are the times when the ball is at 100 meters above sea level.\end{freeResponse}
\end{solution}
Finally, if $h$ is a small positive value what is the meaning of
$f(t+h)$? How does this compare to the meaning of $f(t)+h$?
\begin{solution}
\begin{hint}
We want an answer in the context of the problem. 
\end{hint}
\begin{freeResponse}
The value $f(t+h)$ gives the height of the ball slightly after time
$t$. On the other hand, the value $f(t)+h$ gives a height just higher
than the ball at time $t$.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{solution}
\end{question}
